Connectivity.. Satellite redundancy..

Hardwire communication hubs every 50 miles spread along major shipping channels. In case sattelites/radio waves fail you could have a floating platform hub buoy at sea that a ship could sail to, and connect a fiber line to. The fiber line would be relayed to the sea floor attaching to existing undersea fiber networks

Tri hub.. 1 fiber line going down. Splits into 3 buoys 1 mile apart for 3 ships to connect to in times of turmoil
